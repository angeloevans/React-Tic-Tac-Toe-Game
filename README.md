React Tic-Tac-Toe Game
🎮 Description
This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game built with React. It's designed to showcase basic React concepts such as:

State management using useState

Component-based architecture for reusability

Handling events and passing props for interactivity

Conditional rendering to display game status

The game allows two players to take turns playing, either X or O, and it declares the winner when a player aligns three of their marks either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

💡 Key Features
Two-player game: Players alternate between X and O.

Move history: You can jump back to previous moves.

Winner detection: The game will announce the winner or indicate when it's a tie.

🚀 Technologies Used
React – For building the interactive user interface.

JavaScript (ES6) – For the application logic.
